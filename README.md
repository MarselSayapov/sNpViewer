# sNpViewer
sNpViewer is a desktop application built on the .NET platform. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of analyzing data containing S-parameters, which are widely used in electronics and radio engineering.

The application allows you to open and process files containing these S-parameters and visualize the data in the form of plots. You can create plots displaying the signal's magnitude, its real and imaginary parts, as well as its phase. This is convenient for analyzing the characteristics of signals and components in electronic circuits.

To develop this application, the OxyPlot library was utilized, providing powerful tools for creating plots and data visualization.

This project was undertaken as part of my university assignment. It served as my first experience in developing a desktop application


"Upload your file" - allows you to select and submit a file for processing or use.

"Choose the desired type of graph for plotting" - allows you to select a preferred style or type of graph for creating or displaying data.

"Amplitude" - allows you to display a visual representation of changes in signal, sound, or wave amplitude in the form of a graph.

"Phase" - allows you to display a visual representation of changes in signal, sound, or wave phase in the form of a graph.

"Real Part" - allows you to display a visual representation of changes in the real part of a signal, sound, or wave as a graph.

"Imaginary Part" - allows you to display a visual representation of changes in the imaginary part of a signal, sound, or wave as a graph.

"Convert to dB" - allows you to convert the graph or signal values into a logarithmic decibel scale for a more convenient and visual representation of amplitude or signal level.

"Convert to linear view" - allows you to convert the graph or signal values into a linear scale to display amplitude or signal level in the original form.

"Export magnitude image" allows you to save the appearance or image of the magnitude graph in image format for further use or sharing with others.

"Default zoom" allows you to reset the graph or image to its original scale or zoom level by default.

Graph zooming can be accomplished using the mouse wheel. To zoom in or out of the graph, the user can scroll the mouse wheel forward or backward. Scrolling forward (upward) increases the zoom level, while scrolling backward (downward) decreases it.

For obtaining more precise coordinates of points on the graph, the user can hold the left mouse button on the desired point. When holding the mouse button in a specific position, the coordinates of the point will be displayed or updated in real-time. This allows the user to measure or analyze values on the graph more accurately, providing more precise data for further calculations or interpretation.

To set a custom zoom level for the graph, the user can press the middle mouse button and move the mouse pointer up or down. This action will scale the graph according to the direction of the mouse pointer's movement. This allows the user to freely choose the level of detail and magnification for specific areas of interest on the graph, providing flexibility and precise data exploration.

To move the graph, the user can use the right mouse button. By holding the right button and moving the mouse pointer, the graph will smoothly move according to the direction of the mouse's movement. This allows the user to navigate different areas of the graph and explore data at different scales without changing the zoom level.
