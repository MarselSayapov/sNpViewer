# sNpViewer
sNpViewer is a desktop application built on the .NET platform. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of analyzing data containing S-parameters, which are widely used in electronics and radio engineering.

The application allows you to open and process files containing these S-parameters and visualize the data in the form of plots. You can create plots displaying the signal's magnitude, its real and imaginary parts, as well as its phase. This is convenient for analyzing the characteristics of signals and components in electronic circuits.

To develop this application, the OxyPlot library was utilized, providing powerful tools for creating plots and data visualization.

This project was undertaken as part of my university assignment. It served as my first experience in developing a desktop application
